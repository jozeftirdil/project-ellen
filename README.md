# Project Ellen – Object-Oriented 2D Game Framework (Java)

Project Ellen is a Java-based game project built using the GameLib framework as part of an object-oriented programming course.

## Overview

The project focuses on implementing core game mechanics, actors, actions, behaviours, and controllers using object-oriented design principles.

The implementation includes character logic, movement handling, interaction mechanisms, inventory management, weapon systems, and event-driven behaviours within a 2D game environment.

## Key Highlights

- Object-oriented architecture
- Custom game actors and behaviours
- Use of interfaces and abstraction
- Event-based interactions
- Modular project structure
- Gradle-based build system

## Technologies
